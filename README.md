# Employee-salary-prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regression

This project predicts employee salaries based on features like Age, Gender, Degree, Job Title, and Years of Experience. It uses Random Forest Regression and includes full data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and SHAP-based explainability.
## What I Did

-  Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (removed duplicates and handled missing values).
-  Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using plots like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
-  Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding.
-  Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
-  Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** model.
-  Evaluated the model using RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
-  Visualized feature importance from the model.
-  Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** to explain model predictions.
## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
## Visualizations
- Heatmap of correlations
- Boxplots and histograms of features
- SHAP summary plot for feature impact
